The effects of climate change including drought, soil infertility, lack of minimal soil nutrient to support crop growth with low output have resulted in food insecurity.

    "Description": "The Sedentary Farming Systems Project has been established in one of the most important agricultural areas of Ghana. Due to increasing pressure on land, fallow periods have been shortened drastically. As a consequence, soil fertility can not be regenerated naturally, leading to a gradual degradation of the natural resource base, and hence to a decline in agricultural productivity and growing poverty among the farming population. In order to increase agricultural productivity and farm income through promotion of sustainable sedentary farming systems, the project purpose is the development, adaptation and dissemination of technologies and strategies, which enable farmers and communities to improve their farming, post harvest and marketing systems. The Participatory Technology Development (PTD) concept was chosen, and different technologies were introduced to farmers, farmers󿾒 groups and communities as possible options. However, the project󿾒s expectations with regard to adoption of technologies by the target groups are still not achieved, and only 20% of women farmers are involved in the extension approach. The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of those factors which drive adoption by farmers, to point out cultural and socio-economic background, farmer󿾒s perception, and farm constraints.",

    "Description": "Cocoa smallholder farmers and community leaders in the two target districts were sensitized and empowered to resist illegal mining, as a result of the education provided on its effects on the environment and their livelihoods. Degraded lands were surveyed to ascertain the extent of damage caused, as well as to take samples of soil and water for laboratory analysis, to inform reclamation strategy. Mine-degraded cocoa farmlands were restored, and returned to productive and sustainable agriculture, using Tom󿿩-A󿿧u Agroforestry System (SAFTA) technology. In addition, ageing and abandoned farms prone to the possibility of illegal mining were rehabilitated through the introduction of productivity enhancement practices. The capacity of the beneficiary local government was strengthened to implement mine-degraded farmland restoration, using SAFTA technology, to reduce risks to farms and the community, such as chemical pollution of soil and water resources. Forty frontline staff members involved in cocoa extension services delivery were trained in SAFTA cocoa-based agroforestry, who then trained 3 000 cocoa farmers. In addition, beneficiaries acquired extensive knowledge on the rudiments of SAFTA technology, through knowledge exchange and experience sharing during two study tours organized by the project.",
