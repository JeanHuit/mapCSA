Degraded lands were surveyed to ascertain the extent of damage caused, as well as to take samples of soil and water for laboratory analysis, to inform reclamation strategy. Mine-degraded cocoa farmlands were restored, and returned to productive and sustainable agriculture, using Tomé-Açu Agroforestry System (SAFTA) technology. In addition, ageing and abandoned farms prone to the possibility of illegal mining were rehabilitated through the introduction of productivity enhancement practices. The capacity of the beneficiary local government was strengthened to implement mine-degraded farmland restoration, using SAFTA technology, to reduce risks to farms and the community, such as chemical pollution of soil and water resources. Forty frontline staff members involved in cocoa extension services delivery were trained in SAFTA cocoa-based agroforestry, who then trained 3 000 cocoa farmers. In addition, beneficiaries acquired extensive knowledge on the rudiments of SAFTA technology, through knowledge exchange and experience sharing during two study tours organized by the project.","Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Government of Japan",FAO,Crop Prodcution,Yes ,Yes ,No,Yes,,government,"Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT), Cooperativa Agrícola Mista de Tomé-Açu ([CAMTA], Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), University of Ghana, Ohayo Ghana Foundation",,"KWABIRIBIEM, DENKYEMBOUR",,Completed,2019,2020,,"Agroforestry, cover crops, soil fertility management",FAO,"FAO Representation in

Due to increasing pressure on land, fallow periods have been shortened drastically. As a consequence, soil fertility can not be regenerated naturally, leading to a gradual degradation of the natural resource base, and hence to a decline in agricultural productivity and growing poverty among the farming population. In order to increase agricultural productivity and farm income through promotion of sustainable sedentary farming systems, the project purpose is the development, adaptation and dissemination of technologies and strategies, which enable farmers and communities to improve their farming, post harvest and marketing systems. The Participatory Technology Development (PTD) concept was chosen, and different technologies were introduced to farmers, farmers’ groups and communities as possible options. However, the project’s expectations with regard to adoption of technologies by the target groups are still not achieved, and only 20% of women farmers are involved in the extension approach.

Driven by a belief that a thriving, climate-smart cocoa sector is possible, this project will work with 5,000 farmers in two of Ghana’s main cocoa producing areas: the Ashanti and Eastern regions. Using a landscape approach, the ASASE project moves away from the traditional focus on the direct supply chain and instead intervenes on 3 levels: working together with cocoa farmers, their rural communities and in local forest remnants.","Netherlands Enterprise
