Degraded lands were surveyed to ascertain the extent of damage caused, as well as to take samples of soil and water for laboratory analysis, to inform reclamation strategy. Mine-degraded cocoa farmlands were restored, and returned to productive and sustainable agriculture, using Tomé-Açu Agroforestry System (SAFTA) technology. In addition, ageing and abandoned farms prone to the possibility of illegal mining were rehabilitated through the introduction of productivity enhancement practices. The capacity of the beneficiary local government was strengthened to implement mine-degraded farmland restoration, using SAFTA technology, to reduce risks to farms and the community, such as chemical pollution of soil and water resources. Forty frontline staff members involved in cocoa extension services delivery were trained in SAFTA cocoa-based agroforestry, who then trained 3 000 cocoa farmers.

In order to increase agricultural productivity and farm income through promotion of sustainable sedentary farming systems, the project purpose is the development, adaptation and dissemination of technologies and strategies, which enable farmers and communities to improve their farming, post harvest and marketing systems. The Participatory Technology Development (PTD) concept was chosen, and different technologies were introduced to farmers, farmers’ groups and communities as possible options. However, the project’s expectations with regard to adoption of technologies by the target groups are still not achieved, and only 20% of women farmers are involved in the extension approach.
